Tuples is very weird and in a real world i dont see too much use to it. Since mostly arrays will hold objects or just one type of var

0.A In the prev lesson we say that to declare an array you write the type and add []

    let users : string[] = ['mosh', 'becky']

    With tuples there is a diff syntax

A - Tuples is a way to write multiple type of Vars in an array 

    *Mosh suggests to limit to only two types cause code gets a bit complicated 


B - Write it like this 

    let user: [string, number] = ['mosh', 20302298]

C - They on cons is that array.push it does actually pushes a new var even though we only declared two 

*/

let user: [string, number] = ['mosh', 20302298]

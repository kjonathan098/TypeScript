/*

Tuples is very weird and in a real world i dont see too much use to it. Since mostly arrays will hold object 


A - Tuples is a way to write multiple type of Vars in an array 

    *Mosh suggests to limit to only two types cause code gets a bit complicated 


B - Write it like this 

    let user: [string, number] = ['mosh', 20302298]

*/

let user: [string, number] = ['mosh', 20302298]
